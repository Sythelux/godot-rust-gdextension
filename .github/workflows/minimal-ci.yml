# Minimal CI workflow
# Run when someone opens a PR and adds commits to the PR (this is recognized as a push to master)
# Includes basic checks and unit/integration checks on Linux only

# Known issues:
# 1. Error "Unable to process file command 'env' successfully." means there was an attempt to store multiline-content in a GitHub env var.
#    This should be done as in https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-commands-for-github-actions#multiline-strings:
#       echo 'VAR<<EOF' >> $GITHUB_ENV
#       curl https://example.lab >> $GITHUB_ENV
#       echo 'EOF' >> $GITHUB_ENV
